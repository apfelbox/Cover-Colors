            <p>When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.</p>
            <p>"What was that?" she asked timidly.</p>
            <p>"I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we can go and see."</p>
            <p>Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them.  They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees.  She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.</p>
            <p>One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin.  His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.</p>
